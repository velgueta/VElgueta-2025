## About

This project presents earthquake data recorded with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) at Mount Rainier, WA, as part of my PhD research at the University of Washington. The repository contains figures, event files, and data summaries used in the manuscript *Distributed Acoustic Sensing Records of Earthquakes and Surface Processes at Mount Rainier Volcano* (2025).

## Highlights

- üåã Seismic monitoring using dark fiber near Mount Rainier  
- üìä Event detection with template matching and cross-correlation  
- üìÅ Publicly available data and waveform plots  

## Repository Structure
